
Dear Ms.

It's time to renew your subscription for the Theatre in the Park ç
summer series.  The seating that you had last year will be reç
served for you unless you notify us that you wish to change it.  ç
If you change to another series, we cannot guarantee the same ç
seat, but we will do our best to accommodate you.  Simply inç
dicate your choice on the ticket order form.

This is a special season for Theatre in the Park.  To help celeç
brate ten years of great performances, this year's opening night ç
gala will include Shakespeare, dining, and dancing, all to beneç
fit the City Boys and Girls Club.  This wonderful evening is ç
being generously underwritten by the Morris Corporation, with all ç
proceeds going to the City Boys and Girls Club.  Please let us ç
know on the enclosed form if you wish to join us.
